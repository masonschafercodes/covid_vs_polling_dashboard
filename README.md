# covid_vs_polling_dashboard

covid_vs_polling_dashboard - this is the front-end for the Coronavirus COVID-19 vs 2020 polling data dashboard



## Prerequisites

If you are going to run this locally you need to have mongodb installed and running for this to work - follow the API instructions to get the database up and running with populated data

## Installation and Run

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install required packages and run the server for the backend.

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Run the Frontend with [live-server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)


## Stack
This dashboard uses vanilla js, html, css on the frontend, but takes advantage of some nice javascript libraries like [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/), [c3js](https://c3js.org/), and [d3js](https://d3js.org/) to help display the data in a clean and concise fashion.

## Accessing the backend
Fork and follow installation instructions located above to get this up and running - access the [backend](https://github.com/masonschafercodes/covid_polling_dashboard_backend) here.
